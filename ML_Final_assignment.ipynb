    "In this assignment we will try to find the neighborhood that are very similar to Brooklyn neighborhood of New York. Brooklyn is known for its cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity. Brooklyn has many tourist attractions like Museums, breweries, parks, historic sites and events (Dyker Heights Christmas Lights, Mermaid Parade, Color Runs, Hotdog eating competition, Labor day Carnival to name a few). And it also offers numerous ethnic cuisines to people living and exploring Brooklyn all year long.\n",
    "I have lived in Brooklyn for over 6 years and I always loved the place. And now that I have moved to Canada, I would like to find places in Toronto that offer similar experience at least in terms of food. In this assignment, we would like to\n",

    "To solve this problem, we will first download the New York and Toronto Neighborhood datasets. We will fetch the New york city data from IBM cloud. The New York data contains data for its 5 boroughs including Brooklyn. We will filter this data set to only use Brooklyn Borough data. The data will include the latitude and longitudes for the neighborhood.\n",

    "The Toronto city data is not available as easily as New York city data. We will use the Toronto neighborhood data listed on wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. We will then use python webscraping libraries and tools to extract the required data from the wikipedia page and format it so that we can use it in our project. After cleaning the data, we will use python Geolocation libraries to add Latitude and Longitude information for each neighborhood. And after we have compiled all the data for Toronto, we will merge it with Brooklyn Neighborhood data and use the merged data set for clusetering and analysis."
