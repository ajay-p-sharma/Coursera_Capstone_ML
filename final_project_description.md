## Background:

I have recently moved to Greater Toronto Area from New York. I have been living in the Brooklyn neighborhood of New York for the last 6 years and I absolutely loved it. The population diversity and cultural diversity offered well presented enthnic cuisines for everyone to enjoy. I want to explore Toronto as soon as the Pandemic is over and things start looking more normal. There is no better way to go about exploring a city or neighborhood other than on foot. And it is helpful to know where to start. And if you have a list of top few, that would make life so much easier for you and visiting friends with palates for specific cuisines.

## Problem:

1. I would like to know which neighborhoods in toronto area are closest match to Brooklyn neighborhood of New york.
2. To find the top resturants for at least 5 different cuisines in the toronto area in terms of foot traffic and ratings if possible.


## Input Data:

To solve this problem, I will first combine the New York and Toronto data we used in last assignment. Then I will use the combined data to query Foursquare API to get neighborhood data followed by clustering and cluster analysis find answers to the problems defined above.
